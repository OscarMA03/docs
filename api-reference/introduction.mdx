## Welcome

This API documentation covers all endpoints available in the Builder Prime Agent Service application. The service acts as a proxy to the Builder Prime API while providing additional validation, calendar management, and lead processing capabilities.

## Base URL

```
https://proxy-server-builder-prime.onrender.com
```

## Authentication

Most endpoints require the `BUILDER_PRIME_API_KEY` environment variable to be set. The API key is automatically used for authentication with the Builder Prime backend.

### Company-Specific Authentication

In addition to the global API key, each company has a unique authentication token that must be included in requests to distinguish between different companies and ensure secure access to company-specific information.

#### Required Headers

For endpoints that require company-specific access, include these headers:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer your_company_auth_token_here
X-Company-Token: company_unique_token_12345
```

#### Authentication Levels

- **Global Authentication**: Uses `BUILDER_PRIME_API_KEY` for general API access
- **Company Authentication**: Uses unique company tokens for company-specific data access
- **Webhook Authentication**: Requires both company token and webhook signature verification

#### Security Considerations

- Company tokens are unique per company and should be kept secure
- Tokens should be rotated regularly for enhanced security
- Never log or expose company tokens in client-side code
- Use HTTPS for all API communications

## Response Format

All endpoints return JSON responses with the following structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "Success message"
}
```

Error responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error description",
  "details": "Additional error details"
}
```
