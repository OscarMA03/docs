## Welcome

This API documentation covers all endpoints available in the Proxy Server Builder Prime application. The server acts as a proxy to the Builder Prime API while providing additional validation, calendar management, and lead processing capabilities.

## Base URL

## Authentication

Most endpoints require the `BUILDER_PRIME_API_KEY` environment variable to be set. The API key is automatically used for authentication with the Builder Prime backend.

## Response Format

All endpoints return JSON responses with the following structure:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "message": "Success message"
}
```

Error responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "success": false,

}
```
